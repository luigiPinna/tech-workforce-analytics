# Macrotrends Employee Data Scraper

## Description

This will serve as a backend for a frontend interface aimed at visualizing historical employee data (and potentially other types of data in the future). 

Currently, the script includes a limited set of hardcoded companies, which will be expanded later.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
